  abstract = {Currently, there exists a significant number of green hydrogen production (GHP) technologies based on scaling-up issues (SCUI). Optimal prediction and process optimization could be one of the most substantial SCUI of GHP. Machine learning (ML)-based prediction and optimization of GHP technologies from water industries for a circular economy (CRE) could be a plausible solution for these SCUI. We studied a detailed techno-economic and environmental feasibility study, which recommended proton exchange membrane (PEM) and dark fermentation (DF) as the most promising and environment-friendly technologies for GHP. Thus, the present investigation aims to apply different ML models to predict and optimize the GHP of DF and PEM technologies to solve the SCUI. The results revealed K-nearest neighbor and random forest are the best-fitted models to predict GHP for DF and PEM, correspondingly based on the regression co-efficient (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MEA). The permutation variable index (PVI) recommended that chemical oxygen demand (COD), butyrate, temperature, pH and acetate/butyrate ratio are the most influential process parameters in decreasing order for DF, while temperature, cell areas, cell pressure, cell voltage and catalysts loadings are the most effective process parameters for PEM in reducing order. The partial dependency analysis (PDA) demonstrated GHP increases with increasing COD values up to 10 mg/L, and the optimal temperature range in the DF process is between 25 and 30 °C. On the other hand, cell temperature up to 35 °C should be considered optimum for PEM, and 40–70 cm2 cell areas could produce a significant GHP. In summary, the present study underscores the potential of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) as promising techniques for optimizing GHP, ultimately addressing scaling-up challenges in large-scale industrial GHP production and ensuring a sustainable hydrogen economy (HE).},

  abstract = {<p>There is a growing interest in green hydrogen, with researchers, institutions, and countries focusing on its development, efficiency improvement, and cost reduction. This paper explores the concept of green hydrogen and its production process using renewable energy sources in several leading countries, including Australia, the European Union, India, Canada, China, Russia, the United States, South Korea, South Africa, Japan, and other nations in North Africa. These regions possess significant potential for “green” hydrogen production, supporting the transition from fossil fuels to clean energy and promoting environmental sustainability through the electrolysis process, a common method of production. The paper also examines the benefits of green hydrogen as a future alternative to fossil fuels, highlighting its superior environmental properties with zero net greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, it explores the potential advantages of green hydrogen utilization across various industrial, commercial, and transportation sectors. The research suggests that green hydrogen can be the fuel of the future when applied correctly in suitable applications, with improvements in production and storage techniques, as well as enhanced efficiency across multiple domains. Optimization strategies can be employed to maximize efficiency, minimize costs, and reduce environmental impact in the design and operation of green hydrogen production systems. International cooperation and collaborative efforts are crucial for the development of this technology and the realization of its full benefits.</p>},

  abstract = {<p>As a promising substitute for fossil fuels, hydrogen has emerged as a clean and renewable energy. A key challenge is the efficient production of hydrogen to meet the commercial-scale demand of hydrogen. Water splitting electrolysis is a promising pathway to achieve the efficient hydrogen production in terms of energy conversion and storage in which catalysis or electrocatalysis plays a critical role. The development of active, stable, and low-cost catalysts or electrocatalysts is an essential prerequisite for achieving the desired electrocatalytic hydrogen production from water splitting for practical use, which constitutes the central focus of this review. It will start with an introduction of the water splitting performance evaluation of various electrocatalysts in terms of activity, stability, and efficiency. This will be followed by outlining current knowledge on the two half-cell reactions, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), in terms of reaction mechanisms in alkaline and acidic media. Recent advances in the design and preparation of nanostructured noble-metal and non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts will be discussed. New strategies and insights in exploring the synergistic structure, morphology, composition, and active sites of the nanostructured electrocatalysts for increasing the electrocatalytic activity and stability in HER and OER will be highlighted. Finally, future challenges and perspectives in the design of active and robust electrocatalysts for HER and OER towards efficient production of hydrogen from water splitting electrolysis will also be outlined.</p>},

  abstract = {<p>Hydrogen, as a clean energy carrier, is of great potential to be an alternative fuel in the future. Proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis is hailed as the most desired technology for high purity hydrogen production and self-consistent with volatility of renewable energies, has ignited much attention in the past decades based on the high current density, greater energy efficiency, small mass-volume characteristic, easy handling and maintenance. To date, substantial efforts have been devoted to the development of advanced electrocatalysts to improve electrolytic efficiency and reduce the cost of PEM electrolyser. In this review, we firstly compare the alkaline water electrolysis (AWE), solid oxide electrolysis (SOE), and PEM water electrolysis and highlight the advantages of PEM water electrolysis. Furthermore, we summarize the recent progress in PEM water electrolysis including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts in the acidic electrolyte. We also introduce other PEM cell components (including membrane electrode assembly, current collector, and bipolar plate). Finally, the current challenges and an outlook for the future development of PEM water electrolysis technology for application in future hydrogen production are provided.</p>},

  abstract = {<p>Concerns related to climate change have shifted global attention towards advanced, sustainable, and decarbonized energy systems. While renewable resources such as wind and solar energy offer environmentally friendly alternatives, their inherent variability and intermittency present significant challenges to grid stability and reliability. The integration of renewable energy sources requires innovative solutions to effectively balance supply and demand in the electricity grid. This review explores the critical role of electrolyzer systems in addressing these challenges by providing ancillary services to modern electricity grids. Electrolyzers traditionally used only for hydrogen production have now emerged as versatile tools capable of responding quickly to grid load variations. They can consume electricity during excess periods or when integrated with fuel cells generate electricity during peak demand, contributing to grid stability. Therefore, electrolyzer systems can fulfill the dual function of producing hydrogen for the end-user and offering grid balancing services, ensuring greater economic feasibility. This review paper aims to provide a comprehensive view of the electrolyzer systems’ role in the provision of ancillary services, including frequency control, voltage control, congestion management, and black start. The technical aspects, market, projects, challenges, and future prospects of using electrolyzers to provide ancillary services in modern energy systems are explored.</p>},

The main contributions of the authors could be synthetized as follows: (1) analysis and discussion of the experimental and simulated results regarding solar radiation forecast, as well as energy production prediction and forecasting based on ARIMA and ANN models for two case studies: (a) laboratory BIPV system developed at the Polytechnic University of Bucharest and (b) large PV park placed in a specific site of the south of Romania. A variability index of solar radiation was introduced for the model improvement; (2) comparison between the ARIMA and ANN results to highlight the ARIMA model which is more efficient than the ANN one; (3) optimized method defined by the GMDH model (Group Method of Data Handling) proposed to provide a software program for calculation of the PV energy production.</p>},

  abstract = {<p>&lt;p&gt;In this study, we address point-forecasting using a deep learning LSTM-approach for renewable energy systems with focus on the short- to medium-range. Hourly resolution (medium-range) as well as 10-minute resolution (nowcasting) are the anticipated forecasting frequency. The forecasting approach is applied to: (i) wind speed at 10 meters height (observation sites), (ii) wind speed at hub-height of wind turbines, and (iii) solar power forecasts for selected solar power plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As input to the proposed method numerical weather prediction (NWP) data, gridded observations (analysis and/or reanalysis), and point data are used. The data of studied test-cases is extracted from the Austrian TAWES system (Teilautomatische Wetterstationen, meteorological observations in 10-minute intervals), &amp;#160;SCADA data of wind farms, solar power output of a solar power plant, INCA's (Integrated Nowcasting through Comprehensive Analysis) gridded observation fields, reanalysis fields from Merra2 and Era5-land, as well as, NWP data from the ECMWF IFS (European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecast&amp;#8217;s Integrated Forecasting System). These data-sources embrace very different temporal and spatial semantics, thus, careful pre-processing was carried out. Four daily runs over the course of one year for 12 synoptic sites + 38 wind turbines + 1 solar power plant test locations are conducted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advantage of an LSTM architecture is that it includes recurrent steps in the ANN and, thus, is useful especially for time-series, such as meteorological observations or NWP forecasts. So far, comparatively few attempts have been made to integrate time-series with different semantics of a sensor network and physical models in one LSTM. We tackle this issue by conserving the time-steps of the delayed NWP along with their difference to recently observed time-series and, additionally, separate them into forecasting-intervals (e.g., of 3 to 12 subsequent forecasting hours being shortest in nowcasting). This enables us to employ a sequence-to-sequence LSTM based artificial neural network (ANN). The benefit of a sequence-to-sequence setup is to match an input- and output time-series in each sample, thereby, learning complex temporal relationships. To fully use the advantage of the diverse data a tailored pre- and post-processing of these heterogenous data sources in the renewable energy applications is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ANN&amp;#8217;s results yield, in general, high forecast-skills, indicating a successful learning based on the used training data. Different combinations of inputs and processing-steps were investigated. It is shown that combining various data sources and implement an adequate pre- and post-processing yields the most promising results in the case studies (e.g.: a heuristic to estimate produced power based on the meteorological parameters and prediction of the offset to NWPs tailored to the studied location). Results are compared to traditional forecast methods and statistical methods such as a random forest and multiple-linear-regression.&lt;/p&gt;</p>},
